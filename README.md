Script that uses a Firefox webdriver to loop through commonly used application websites in order to setup a new computer.
# Description
This script leverages a Firefox webdriver and iterates through a dictionary of commonly downloaded files.  I created this in preparation for starting a new job.  It's a dull pain to naviagate to all the downlad pages for commonly used programs.  Although it doesn't take too long to do so, this takes less time.  Automat the boring stuff!
